- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that will expand my knowledge and skills. I have a passion and a true care for people and would love to be able to work on projects that are trying to make a difference.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting a better understanding of C++. OOP. preping for internships/interviews and looking for study groups as all of my school has been online which has limited my ability to network.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything food related. If you need to know how to make something happen in the kitchen, dont be afraid to ask. I love to teach all the tricks i've learned over the years.
